# alconometer

Inspired by the cronometer app.

An app to record and track your alcohol intake.

This is WIP and basically a learning exercise for myself.

It uses Firestore Realtime Database which isn't necessarily the best choice.  This is something I had not used before so thought I'd have a play.
